# SimpleGarminLike Watch Face

This is my fifth (or sixth... mayube seventh!) attempt to build a watch face.
I was inspired by a Garmin official WF that did not match all my expectations.

1. Install the watchface through Garmin's store (pay attention it is only compatible with 240 pixels rounded screen for now)
2. Go to Garmin Express app on your phone and set your options
3. Enjoy!
